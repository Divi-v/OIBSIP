The provided Java code is a basic Online Reservation System for train bookings. It includes user authentication, reservation creation, and cancellation. Users must log in with a username and password, and they can make reservations by specifying details like their name, chosen train, class type, date of journey, source, and destination. The system maintains reservation data in arrays and has a limit of 150 reservations. It offers a text-based console interface with a menu system for user interactions. While this code serves as a simple example, real-world reservation systems would require additional features such as payment processing, user profiles, and enhanced security measures.



A number guessing game in Java is an interactive text-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a defined range. Players input guesses, and the game provides feedback, indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the hidden number, keeping track of the number of attempts. Upon a successful guess, the game congratulates the player, reveals the hidden number, and displays the number of attempts made. Number guessing games are not only entertaining but also serve as programming exercises to practice logical thinking and input validation in Java.
